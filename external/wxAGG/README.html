        <img src="doc/images/screen.png">
        <p>
        wxAGG is a simple example showing one way to combine the
        cross-platform user interface library
        <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> with the vector
        <a href="http://antigrain.com/">Anti-Grain Geometry</a> (AGG) renderer.  The
        interesting class is AGGWindow, a wxWindow that stores a bitmap (in the native
        format of your platform) and directs AGG to render directly into the
        bitmap.  This bitmap is then used to paint the window when requested
        by the rest of the wxWidgets framework.  The source should hopefully
        be self-explanatory.

        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>
        This code was written by Adrian Secord and is placed in the public
        domain.  I can't provide support, but I would like to hear of
        problems.  You can contact me by 
        <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~ajsecord/email.html">email</a>, or using
        the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Adrian+Secord%22">usual tools</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Building</h2>

        <p>
        Two integrated development environment setups are included in the
        <code>ide</code> directory: one for
        Apple's XCode 2.x environment and one for Microsoft's Visual Studio
        .NET 2003 environment (also known as version 7).  The Visual Studio
        setup should also work in later versions.  A Unix-style makefile is
        not provided but should be trivial to create.  
        </p>

        <p>The code has the two obvious dependencies: wxWidgets and AGG.
        </p>

        <h3>wxWidgets</h3>
        <p>
        The IDE setups assume that you have already installed wxWidgets in
        your environment in such a way that the compiler will find the
        headers, etc. without any special configuration.  Under Windows you
	should install the wxWidget packages in <code>C:\wxWidgets</code> and 
	make sure you can compile and run the included examples.  Apple's OS X
        includes version 2.53 of wxWidgets pre-installed in <code>/usr</code>, 
        so unless you need a later version, you do not need to do anything
        more.  If you want to use another version of wxWidgets, you will need
        to modify the build settings to find the headers, the libraries, and,
	on OS X, check that the pre-processor defines emitted by the command
	<code>wx-config --cppflags</code> match those in the project settings.
	</p>
	<p>
	wxAGG has been tested with wxWidgets versions 2.53 under OS X and 2.80
	under Windows XP, but should work with most versions.
	</p>

        <h3>AGG</h3>
        <p>
        Since most users will not have AGG pre-installed, wxAGG expects to
        find the AGG source distribution in <code>libraries/agg</code> under
        the main wxAGG directory.  
        
        <ol>
            <li>Download an AGG source distribution from
            <a href="http://antigrain.com/">Anti-Grain's website</a>.</li>
            <li>Unpack the package to into <code>libraries</code>.</li>
            <li>Rename the resulting directory (for example,
            <code>agg-2.4</code>) to be just <code>agg</code>.</li>
            <li>As a check, the file <code>libraries/agg/readme</code> should
            exist.</li>
        </ol>

        wxAGG has been tested with version 2.4 and 2.5, but should work with later
        versions.  Note that the AGG license changed after version 2.4 from
        the LGPL to the GPL.  If you use a later version that added or deleted
        files you will need to mirror these changes in the IDE project files.
        </p>

        <p> 
        If you already have the AGG source distribution stored elsewhere,
        then on Unix-like systems you can simply create a symbolic link under
        <code>libraries</code> called <code>agg</code> that points to the
        correct directory.  
        </p>
